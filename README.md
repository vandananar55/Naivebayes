# NAIVE-BAYES

this is an ML project in which we are using  GUASSIAN NAIVE BAYES and MULTINOMIAL NAIVE BAYES algorithm to identify whether it is bot/fake account or not.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

1. open csv file to load data
2. explore data 
3. handling null values
4. training and test data splitting
5. applying guassian naive bayes algorithm
6. Checking training and testing accuracy
7. checking model accuracy
8. CONFUSION MATRIX
9. classification report
10. applying multinomial naive bayes algorithm with laplace smoothing
11. repeating steps from 6 to 9 for multinomial algorithm 

# download data
download data from bot_accounts.csv

# description of dataset
check description of dataset from DESCRIPTION OF DATASET.odt

# handling null values
# columndescription.py
to handle null values import class from columdescription.py file.

# naive.py
This file is used to get the required result from trained  model. To run this file, execute the following command :

```
naive.py
```
